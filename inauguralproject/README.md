# Inaugural project

The main point of this project is to solve and simulate a labor market model. We do this by applying different algorithm in order to optimize the model and present the results visually in the project. The labor market model is solved in (1) by optimizing the utility given the budget restriction. With the result from (1) we plotted the labor supply and consumption as a function of the labor wage, this is shown in (2). In (3) we are calculating the labor tax revenue followed by an analysis of how the elasticity of labor supply effect the labor tax revenue (4). Last, we find the optimal tax rates and cut-off for the labor income bracket (5).  

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [inauguralproject.ipynb](inauguralproject.ipynb).
