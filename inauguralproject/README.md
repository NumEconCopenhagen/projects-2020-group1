# Inaugural project

The main point of this project is to solve and simulate a labour market model. We do this by applying diffrent algoritsm in order to optimize the model and present the results visualy in the project. The labour market model is solved in (1) by optimizing the utility given the budget restriction. With the result from (1) we plottet the labour supply and consumption as a function of the labour wage, this is shown in (2). In (3) we are calculating the labour tax revenue followed by a analysis of how the elasticity of labor supply effet the labour tax revenue (4). Last we find the optimal tax rates and cut-off for the labor income bracket (5).  

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [inauguralproject.ipynb](inauguralproject.ipynb).
