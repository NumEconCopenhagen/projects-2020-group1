# Data analysis project

Our project is titled **Covid-19 from a international perspective** and is about the spread of the famous Corona virus. We use day-to-day data with following three variables: confirmed cases, recovered cases and death from covid-19 where all the data is on country level. 

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [dataproject.ipynb](dataproject.ipynb).

This project **use four datasets**:
