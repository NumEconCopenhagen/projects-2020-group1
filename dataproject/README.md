# Data analysis project

Our project is titled **A graphical analysis of Covid-19 from an international perspective** and is about the spread of the famous Corona virus. We use day-to-day data with following three variables: confirmed cases, recovered cases and death from covid-19 where all the data is on country level. We present the data in various ways including tables, scatterplots and bobble charts. 

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [dataproject.ipynb](dataproject.ipynb).
The output (graphs and tables) of the project has cursed us a bit of trouble, because it does not show properly in Jupyter - We recommend opening our project in VSC.
