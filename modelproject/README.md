# Model analysis project

Our project is titled **Cass-Koopman's Model for optimal Growth** and consists of solving and simulating the model. 

In the beginning of the project we find the optimal growth paths for consumption and capital from a socialplanners perspective. We test the model with different parameter values and present the results grafically. In the end of the project we add an environmental term to the model whith changes the paths of the consumption and capital. 

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [modelproject.ipynb](modelproject.ipynb).

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires no further packages.
