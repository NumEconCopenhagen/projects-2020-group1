# Model analysis project

Our project is titled **Ramsey/Cass-Koopmans Model** and consists of solveing and simulating the famous Ramsey/Cass-Koopmans Model. We test the model with different parameter values and present the result grafically.

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [modelproject.ipynb](modelproject.ipynb).

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires no further packages.
