# Model analysis project

Our project is titled **Cass-Koopman's Model for optimal Growth** and consists of solving and simulating the model. We test the model with different parameter values and present the results grafically.

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [modelproject.ipynb](modelproject.ipynb).

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires no further packages.
