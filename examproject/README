**EXAMS PROJECT**

The exam project consists of three different parts; Linear regression, Durable purchases and Gradient descent.

The results of the project can be found here: **HEEEERE**


**content:**
**Linear regression:** 
Estimating and plotting a linear regression with two different solvers (OLS and LED). The results where shown in a plot. 
In this exercise, we learned how to solve a linear regression with both OLS and LED and presenting the estimaters graficly.

**Durable purchases:** 
Optimizing and plotting different kinds of consumptions and valuefunction in an dynamic intertemperal household problem. 
In this exercise, we learned how to optimize parameters in different time periods in an economic model. At last we leaned how to solve a model with a piecewise function.

**Gradient descent:** 
Creat and implement an algorithm for the purpose of finding a minimum in a function two dimentional function. 
In this exercise, we learned how to step by step construct an algorithm with a Jacobian matrix.
